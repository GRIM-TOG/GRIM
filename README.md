# GRIM (Grasp Realignment via Iterative Matching)

## Overview
This project implements a memory system for reinforcement learning agents, focusing on efficient memory creation, storage, and utilization for improved learning performance.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main entry point for the application
- `memory/`: Contains memory-related implementations
  - `memory.json`: Memory data storage
- `eval.py`: Evaluation scripts and metrics

## TODO List

### 1. Memory Creation Pipeline
- [ ] Design memory encoding scheme
- [ ] Implement experience replay buffer
- [ ] Add prioritized experience replay
- [ ] Create memory sampling strategies
- [ ] Optimize memory writing/reading operations

### 2. Memory Data Management
- [ ] Define memory data structure
- [ ] Implement memory compression
- [ ] Add memory versioning
- [ ] Create backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Optimize memory storage format

### 3. Dataset Post-Processing
- [ ] Implement data normalization
- [ ] Add data augmentation pipeline
- [ ] Create dataset splitting utilities
- [ ] Add data validation checks
- [ ] Implement data visualization tools

### 4. Evaluation Code
- [ ] Implement baseline models
- [ ] Add performance metrics
- [ ] Create visualization for results
- [ ] Add comparison with existing methods
- [ ] Implement automated testing suite

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`
